# COMP551 Mini-Project 2: SGD & Text Classification

## Description
* *Part 1:* Observe gradient descent preformance as pramaters vary for the diabetes dataset
* *Part 2:* Preproccess fake-news data for binary classification model by mapping raw text details to text features and build a model to predict if text is human or computer-generated 

## Notes:
* Include the datasets in the same directory as the repository in a folder named `data` with the `diabetes` and `fake_news` files inside

## TODO:
- [ ] Set up logistic regression and gradient descent functions from files
- [ ] Find converging GD solution by optimizing learning rates and maximum iterations of the GD function
- [ ] Find relationship between gradient normal and validation accuracy as a function of learning rate and maximum iterations
