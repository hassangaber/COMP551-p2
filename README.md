# COMP551 Mini-Project 2: SGD & Text Classification

## Description

* Preform SGD on Diabetes dataset and understand how different methods of gradient descent impact the convergence speed of the model.
* Explore text data preprocessing for models on the fake news dataset.
* Apply binary classification methods using logistic regression for both datasets. 

## Notes:

* Include the datasets in the same directory as the repository in a folder named `data` with the `diabetes` and `fake_news` files inside
